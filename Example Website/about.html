            <h3>Who we are</h3>
            
           	<p>
            	Sterling Auto Care is owned by Bill Fulton, a master certified automotive technician for over 35 years. Tired of watching previous employers taking advantage of wary customers, Sterling Auto Care was founded with the goal of providing reliable, high-quality automotive services to customers at a price they can afford and that’s it; just simple automotive repair without any of the headaches or deceit.  Rather than trying to charge as much as possible every visit, our policy is to treat our customers like family and keep them coming back for years to come; something that everyone involved can profit from. Over the past 20 years, both employees and clientele have agreed that this is a good policy to have. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Here at Sterling Auto Care we realize just how important a vehicle can be in somebody’s life. A vehicle is your livelihood, a ticket to freedom, a vessel of self-expression, and a lifeline for keeping in touch with the world. As such, we take maintaining your vehicle very seriously.  Allow our technicians to keep your vehicle running as smoothly as possible so that you can keep doing what you do. Give us a call today and we promise you will not be disappointed.
            </p>
